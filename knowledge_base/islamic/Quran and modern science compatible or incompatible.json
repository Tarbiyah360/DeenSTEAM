Initially he could not believe thatthe Qur’an mentioned this scientific fact 1,400years ago. He later verified the translation of thisparticular Qur’anic verse. Prof. Tejasen was soimpressed by the scientific accuracy of the Qur’anicverse, that at the 8th Saudi Medical Conferenceheld in Riyadh on the Scientific Signs of Qur’an andSunnah, he proudly proclaimed in public:\n“There is no God but Allah and\nMuhammad (pbuh) is His Messenger.”\n65* For more Queries contact:  webmaster@irf.netISLAMIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION\n/G53/G70/G72/G65/G61/G64/G69/G6E/G67/G20/G74/G68/G65/G20/G54/G72/G75/G74/G68/G20/G6F/G66/G20/G49/G73/G6C/G61/G6D\n/G77/G77/G77/G2E/G69/G72",
